# Node.js CLI utility for BlinkStick smart LED controllers

This is a minimal CLI utility for controlling smart LEDs such as the BlinkStick Nano: https://www.blinkstick.com/products/blinkstick-nano

I created this for personal needs due to the official `blinkstick-cli` package not working with recent Linux distributions.
The only dependency for this package is the `node-hid` library.

You can run the utility with `npx blinkstick` or if you install globally with just `blinkstick`.

I have tested this with BlinkStick Nano, however it should work with other models just as well.

## Usage

Turn on a LED: `blinkstick red`

Turn on a LED other than the first one: `blinkstick 1 red` (indexing starts from 0)

Turn off a LED: `blinkstick off`

Blink a LED: `blinkstick red blink` (stop by terminating the program with e.g. ctrl-C)

Possible colors: **red**, **yellow**, **green**, **cyan**, **blue**, **magenta**, **white**

## Adjusting brightness

You can append a brightness setting from 1 to 8 to any of the commands listed above.

For example: `blinkstick blue 8` (for maximum brightness)

The lowest brightness 1 is very dim, and it is possible that it does not even turn on the LED on all BlinkStick models. 8 sets the LED to its maximum brightness.

## BlinkStick class

Actual control of the device takes place from the `BlinkStick` class under the `lib` directory. Depending on your needs, you may find this class useful by itself.
